              Hi! I'm Jessica! ðŸ‘‹
            </h2>

              I'm a first generation high school graduate and college attendee.
              I've always been driven to find what I'm passionate about, and I
              found my passion for QA in 2013 at my first QA job.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since then, I've found a passion for writing code (specifically
              JavaScript) and really enjoy spending time on automation. I don't
              believe there's a replacement for manual QA, but I believe
              automated testing allows passionate testers to do more of what
              they love: test all the things!
