            I'm a first generation high school graduate and college attendee.
            I've always been driven to find what I'm passionate about, and I
            found my passion for QA in 2013 at my first QA job.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since then, I've found a passion for writing code (specifically
            JavaScript) and really enjoy spending time on automation. I don't
            believe there's a replacement for manual QA, but I believe automated
            testing allows passionate testers to do more of what they love: test
            all the things!
