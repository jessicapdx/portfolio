              I've been in the tech industry for 8 years, with a focus on
              Quality Assurance. I truly enjoy detective work and learning from
              the developers that I work with. I am <i>always</i> learning
              something new (even in my personal time, like the hours I invested
              to build this website by myself)!
              <br />
              <br />
              Before QA, I was in the medical field and studied Medical Office
              Administration. While working in the medical field, I was
              motivated by coworkers and friends to pursue an opportunity in
              tech, and that's when I discovered my passion for QA.
